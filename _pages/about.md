I'm currently a PhD student in the Quantitative Imaging Methods Laboratory in the Department of Radiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I started in the fall of 2018 in the Medical Physics program. My research interests are in quantitative MRI and machine learning.

I received my Bachelor's from UW-Madison in 2018 in Physics and Math, where I worked on several research projects throughout my undergrad. I started in astrophysics in 2014 working with the [HAWC](https://hawc.wipac.wisc.edu/home) project, where I used the shadow of the moon to.
