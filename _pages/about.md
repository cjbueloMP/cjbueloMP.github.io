I'm currently a PhD student in the [Quantitative Imaging Methods Laboratory](https://qiml.radiology.wisc.edu/) in the Department of Radiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working under Diego Hernando and Scott Reeder. I started in the fall of 2018 in the Medical Physics program. My research projects include developing and validating methods for MRI-based quantification of iron overload, developing techniques for MR imaging near metallic biopsy markers in breast cancer, and implementing AI-based automated MR image prescription for abdominal imaging.

I received my Bachelor's from UW-Madison in 2018 in Physics and Math, where I worked on several research projects throughout my undergrad. I started in astrophysics in 2014 working with the [High Altitude Water Cherenkov](https://hawc.wipac.wisc.edu/home) project, where I used the shadow of the moon to developer detector quality characteristics. I then moved to engineering where I worked on the [Helically Symmetric Experiment](https://hsx.wisc.edu/) where I designed and implemented a camera system to image the edge of the plasma of the HSX [Stellarator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator). I also worked in the [Fetal Biomagnetism](https://www.medphysics.wisc.edu/wp/research/biomagnetism/) lab at UW-Madison, where I worked to improve the quality of measurement of Atomic Magnetometers, a less expensive and more accessible alternative to the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device currently used.

## About me

I spend time with my girlfriend and our rescue kitten, Kylo. I play ultimate frisbee in the summers in the [Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association's](www.mufa.org) rec league.

I grew up just outside of Madison in Middleton where I attended Middleton High School.
