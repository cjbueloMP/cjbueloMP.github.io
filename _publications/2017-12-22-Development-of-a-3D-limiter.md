excerpt: 'A visible camera diagnostic has been developed to study the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) limiter plasma interaction. A straight line view from the camera location to the limiter was not possible due to the complex 3D stellarator geometry of HSX, so it was necessary to insert a mirror/lens system into the plasma edge. A custom support structure for this optical system tailored to the HSX geometry was designed and installed. This system holds the optics tube assembly at the required angle for the desired view to both minimize system stress and facilitate robust and repeatable camera positioning. The camera system has been absolutely calibrated and using Hα and C-III filters can provide hydrogen and carbon photon fluxes, which through an S/XB coefficient can be converted into particle fluxes. The resulting measurements have been used to obtain the characteristic penetration length of hydrogen and C-III species. The hydrogen λiz value shows reasonable agreement with the value predicted by a 1D penetration length calculation.'
